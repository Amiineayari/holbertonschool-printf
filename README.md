    <h1>holbertonschool-printf project</h1>
    <p>This is a project for Holberton School students to learn about the printf function in C programming language.</p>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to create our own version of the printf function in C programming language. The printf function is a standard function in C that is used to print output to the console or other output streams. It allows the programmer to format the output according to specific rules, such as the type of data being printed, the width and precision of the output, and the number of arguments being passed to the function.</p>

<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>The project requirements are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a function that mimics the behavior of the printf function.</li>
  <li>The function should be able to handle the following conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d, i, u, o, x, X, p.</li>
  <li>The function should be able to handle the following flags: -, 0, ., *.</li>
  <li>The function should be able to handle the following length modifiers: hh, h, l, ll.</li>
  <li>The function should pass all the test cases provided by Holberton School.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use the printf function</h2>
<p>To use the printf function, include the "holberton.h" header file in your C program and call the function with the appropriate format specifier and arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>printf("Hello, %s!", "world");</code>
